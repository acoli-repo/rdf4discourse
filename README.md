Discourse parsing with RDF/LOD technology
==
Discourse parsing is concerned with understanding the hierarchical and relational structure of utterances in a text. Discourse semantics complement semantic parsing by capturing context dependencies and allowing to aggregate information over multiple sentences.

This involves several dimensions:

* discourse structure (hierarchical organization of the discourse)
* discourse relations (coherence relations between multiple discourse segments)
* discourse markers (explicit cues for discourse relations)
* frame semantics (implicit semantic roles)
* anaphora (coreference, bridging, event anaphora)
* etc.

We do not provide an exhaustive treatment of discourse parsing here, but we study the application of RDF/LOD technologies to *selected aspects*, only. Research on discourse semantics which do not directly depend on either RDF or LOD technology is being dealt with in separate ACoLi repositories.
