# Discourse marker inventories

Multilingual and Interlinked Discourse Marker Inventories in OntoLex-Lemon.

While this is similar in goal and spirit with TextLink/DimLex, and partially builds on their data and specifications, notable improvements over the DimLex/TextLink data are that

- we include additional languages and repositories for which no DimLex XML edition has been available, so far
- we provide a format with machine-readable semantics (concept references rather than plain strings for relation identification)
- we publish the discourse marker inventories as Linked Data, so that they can be directly queried, e.g., with public webservices such as [sparql.org](http://sparql.org/sparql?query=++++PREFIX+ontolex%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2Fns%2Flemon%2Fontolex%23%3E%0D%0A++++PREFIX+rdfs%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2F01%2Frdf-schema%23%3E%0D%0A++++PREFIX+owl%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2002%2F07%2Fowl%23%3E%0D%0A++++PREFIX+rdf%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1999%2F02%2F22-rdf-syntax-ns%23%3E%0D%0A++++PREFIX+olia%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Folia%2Fdiscourse%2Folia_discourse.owl%23%3E%0D%0A%0D%0A++++SELECT+%3Fmarker+%3Frelation%0D%0A++++FROM+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Facoli%2Fdimlex%2Fen%2Fpdtb2.ttl%3E%0D%0A++++WHERE+%7B%0D%0A++++++%3Fentry+%28ontolex%3AotherForm%7Contolex%3AcanonicalForm%7Contolex%3AlexicalForm%29+%3Fform.%0D%0A++++++%3Fform+ontolex%3AwrittenRep+%3Fmarker.%0D%0A++++++%3Fentry+%28ontolex%3Asense%7C%5Eontolex%3AisSenseOf%29+%3Fsense.%0D%0A++++++%3Fsense+%28ontolex%3Areference%7C%5Eontolex%3AisReferenceOf%29+%3Frelation.%0D%0A++++%7D&default-graph-uri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Facoli%2Fdimlex%2Fen%2Fpdtb2.ttl&output=xml&stylesheet=%2Fxml-to-html.xsl)
- we link the discourse marker inventories against the PDTB model of the [OLiA Discourse Extensions](https://github.com/acoli-repo/olia)
- we can use the OLiA Discourse Extensions to create (indirect) links (and a mapping to) other discourse theories, resp., annotation frameworks, most notably, CCR, ISO SemAF and RST

General workflow:
- Collect various discourse marker inventories (see [`src/`](src))
- Convert to DimLex XML / validate against DimLex DTD
- Convert to OntoLex-Lemon in RDF/TTL (see [`lemon/`](lemon))
- Link discourse relations (lexical concepts) with the OLiA Discourse Extensions (see [`linked/`](linked))
- Publish discourse markers under resolvable URIs (URIs in the discourse marker inventories resolve, e.g., [`pdtb:14_then`](http://purl.org/acolidimlex/en/pdtb2.ttl#14_then) resolves to [http://purl.org/acoli/dimlex/en/pdtb2.ttl](http://purl.org/acoli/dimlex/en/pdtb2.ttl)).
- Experiments on the resulting data ;) For example, using [http://sparql.org](http://sparql.org/sparql.html) with the following query:

	    PREFIX ontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#>
	    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
	    PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
	    PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
	    PREFIX olia: <http://purl.org/olia/discourse/olia_discourse.owl#>
	    SELECT ?marker ?relation
	    FROM <http://purl.org/acoli/dimlex/en/pdtb2.ttl>
	    WHERE {
	      ?entry (ontolex:otherForm|ontolex:canonicalForm|ontolex:lexicalForm) ?form.
	      ?form ontolex:writtenRep ?marker.
	      ?entry (ontolex:sense|^ontolex:isSenseOf) ?sense.
	      ?sense (ontolex:reference|^ontolex:isReferenceOf) ?relation.
	    }

In addition to OntoLex-Lemon, a more reader-friendly (but non-exhaustive) TSV representation can be generated by

    $> cd parcor/bibles
    $> make gazetteers

For English, the resulting file `parcos/bibles/gazetters/en/pdtb2.tsv` will be a table in TSV format (tab-separated values, i.e., CSV with TAB as separator):

    ?string	?label	?rst	?oliaDistance	?basicOp	?order	?polarity	?source	?temporality
    "In other words"@en	"equivalence.Restatement.EXPANSION"	"MultiNuclearRestatement"	3	"Additive|Causal"		"Positive"	"Objective|Subjective"
    "In other words"@en	"equivalence.Restatement.EXPANSION"	"Summary"	3	"Additive|Causal"		"Positive"	"Objective|Subjective"

This corresponds to the following table:

| `?string`             | `?label`                              | `?rst`                      | `?oliaDistance` | `?basicOp`           | `?order`     | `?polarity`               | `?source` | `?temporality` |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|--------------------|------------|-------------------------|---------|--------------|
| "In other words"@en | "equivalence.Restatement.EXPANSION" | "MultiNuclearRestatement" | 3             | "Additive\|Causal" | "Positive" | "Objective\|Subjective" |         |              |
| "In other words"@en | "equivalence.Restatement.EXPANSION" | "Summary"                 | 3             | "Additive\|Causal" | "Positive" | "Objective\|Subjective" |         |              |

Here, `?string` is the (string form of the) discourse marker, with Turtle-style annotation for the language (`@en`), `?label` is the path in the PDTB hierarchy, `?rst` is a possible RST interpretation, `?oliaDistance` quantifies the mismatch between PDTB and RST (higher values indicate more loose fit), `?basicOp` and the following columns are CCR features (`|` indicates alternative interpretations, no value indicates underspecification). Both RST and CCR interpretations are derived from the original PDTB annotation. When using this table as a gazetteer for PDTB, RST or CCR, you need to aggregate over all rows for a given marker in order to get all possible interpretations.

### Notes

The generated URIs are redirected to an external hosting service (currently GitHub). However, neither this hosting service [nor any other public hosting service we are aware of](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2021/14541/pdf/OASIcs-LDK-2021-5.pdf) does allow us to declare them with the correct mediatype (`text/turtle`). For this reason, we include the file extension (`.ttl`) in the URIs. This is considered bad practice in knowledge representation, but it allows remote SPARQL engines to *heuristically* guess the correct format. However, this is heuristic is not guaranteed to work and may fail under some systems. It is confirmed to work with [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) and with the public SPARQL service under [sparql.org](http://sparql.org/sparql.html).

- The creation of the OntoLex-Lemon edition of Discourse Marker Inventories has been initiated in 2017 in the context of the BMBF Research Group [LiODi. Linked Open Dictionaries](http://www.acoli.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/liodi.html) and was subsequently conducted at the Applied Computational Linguistics (ACoLi) Lab of Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, under coordination by Christian Chiarcos.
- Our work on linking them has been conducted  in the context of the H2020 Research and Innovation Action [Pret-a-LLOD. Ready-to-use Multilingual Linked Language Data for Knowledge Services across Sectors](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/825182) (Grant Agreement 825182, 2019-2022).
- Our more recent work on their multilingual extension is being conducted in the context of Use Case 4.2.2 of the Cost Action [Nexus Linguarum. European network for Web-centred linguistic data science](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA18209/) (2019-2023).

When working with any specific inventory, please see license information and acknowledgments for the original data in [`src/`](src). We partially build on earlier achievements of the Cost Action [TextLink. Structuring Discourse in Multilingual Europe](https://www.cost.eu/actions/IS1312/), and especially the work of the [Discourse Lab at the University of Potsdam, Germany](https://github.com/discourse-lab/dimlex).  In particular, we use DimLex-XML as an intermediate format during conversion, and a number of datasets covered here have been originally developed in TextLink.
