# Discourse marker inventories

Multilingual and Interlinked Discourse Marker Inventories in OntoLex-Lemon.

While this is similar in goal and spirit with TextLink/DimLex, and partially builds on their data and specifications, notable improvements over the DimLex/TextLink data are that

- we include additional languages and repositories for which no DimLex XML edition has been available, so far
- we provide a format with machine-readable semantics (concept references rather than plain strings for relation identification)
- we publish the discourse marker inventories as Linked Data, so that they can be directly queried, e.g., with public webservices such as [sparql.org](http://sparql.org/sparql?query=PREFIX+ontolex%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2Fns%2Flemon%2Fontolex%23%3E%0D%0APREFIX+rdfs%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2F01%2Frdf-schema%23%3E%0D%0APREFIX+owl%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2002%2F07%2Fowl%23%3E%0D%0APREFIX+rdf%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F1999%2F02%2F22-rdf-syntax-ns%23%3E%0D%0APREFIX+olia%3A+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Folia%2Fdiscourse%2Folia_discourse.owl%23%3E%0D%0A%0D%0ASELECT+%3Fmarker+%3Frelation%0D%0AFROM+%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Facoli%2Fdimlex%2Fen%2Fpdtb2.ttl%3E%0D%0AWHERE+%7B%0D%0A%3Fentry+%28ontolex%3AotherForm%7Contolex%3AcanonicalForm%7Contolex%3AlexicalForm%29+%3Fform.%0D%0A%3Fform+ontolex%3AwrittenRep+%3Fmarker.%0D%0A%3Fentry+%28ontolex%3Asense%7C%5Eontolex%3AisSenseOf%29+%3Fsense.%0D%0A%3Fsense+%28ontolex%3Areference%7C%5Eontolex%3AisReferenceOf%29+%3Frelation.%0D%0A%7D&default-graph-uri=&output=xml&stylesheet=%2Fxml-to-html.xsl)
- we link the discourse marker inventories against the PDTB model of the [OLiA Discourse Extensions](https://github.com/acoli-repo/olia)
- we can use the OLiA Discourse Extensions to create (indirect) links (and a mapping to) other discourse theories, resp., annotation frameworks, most notably, CCR, ISO SemAF and RST

General workflow:
- Collect various discourse marker inventories (see [`src/`](src))
- Convert to DimLex XML / validate against DimLex DTD
- Convert to OntoLex-Lemon in RDF/TTL (see [`lemon/`](lemon))
- Experiments on the resulting data ;)

In addition to OntoLex-Lemon, a more reader-friendly TSV (but incomplete) representation can be generated by

  $> cd parcor/bibles
  $> make gazetteers

We ground our work and build massively on earlier achievements in [TextLink](http://textlink.ii.metu.edu.tr/), and especially the work of the [Discourse Lab at the University of Potsdam, Germany](https://github.com/discourse-lab/dimlex).
