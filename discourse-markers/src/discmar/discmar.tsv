In Spanish and Catalan their primary meaning is revision ( [ex] and [ex]), respectively) comparable to it is true that. The kind of revision that these discourse markers tend to convey in Spanish and Catalan is correction (a prototypical example of correction would be: ``This is not black, but white.''). We can speculate that the reason why the revision meaning of these discourse markers is more primary in Spanish or Catalan than in English is because in these languages the correction meaning tends to be expressed by discourse markers, as can be seen in the fact that it is lexicalized (sinó, sino), while in English it is covered by the all-purpose revision discourse marker but, and correction is only distinguished from other kinds of revision by other linguistic features.

It seems that it has contrastive functions, which can be best attributed to the properties of continuation than to any possible revision. It is comparable to topic-based but, but in that case there seems to be more correlation with items signalling negative polarity, which seems to support an interpretation as revision. In this respect, it is different from anyway, which always conveys revision.

Compare the following example with the example for in sum. With respect to the effects on coherence and relevance, it is comparable to consecutive discourse markers like that's why or so then, which can also signal relations that are not motivated by a causal relation in the real world, but have the same rhetorical strength as those that are motivated by a real causal relation. It is comparable to in effect.	
137	en	in conclusion						The European Court further ruled in this case that Arts 48 and 59 of the EC Treaty do not prevent a member state from requiring that the exercise of the profession of auditor in that state by a person qualified to carry on that profession in another member state be conditions which are objectively necessary to guarantee observation of professional rules concerning the permanence of the infrastructure in place for the completion of the work, the effective presence in the member state and assurance of the observation of professional ethics, unless respect for such rules and conditions is already guaranteed by a reviseur d'entreprises, whether a natural person or a firm, established and recognised in the state, and in whose service is placed, for the duration of the work, the person who intends to exercise the profession of auditor. In conclusion, one has to wonder whether the borders are in fact open.
