\title{Inducing Discourse Relations}

corpus-based induction

corpus eval against TED-MDB. We evaluate only against languages for which we have discourse marker inventories other than TED-MDB. Hence, we consider only German, English and Portuguese. Lithuanian, Polish, Russian and Turkish are excluded.

Other possible evaluation data: https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/Shallow-Discourse-Annotation-for-Chinese-TED-Talks/tree/master/Dataset%20for%20Shallow%20Discourse%20Annotation%20for%20Chinese%20TED%20Talks%20Accepted%20by%20LREC2020/Ann16/tokens, but these texts are not aligned with TED talkids
