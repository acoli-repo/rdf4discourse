Embrace	_
the	_
near	_
win	_
I	_
feel	_
so	_
fortunate	_
that	_
my	_
first	_
job	_
was	_
working	_
at	_
the	_
Museum	_
of	_
Modern	_
Art	_
on	_
a	_
retrospective	_
of	_
painter	_
Elizabeth	_
Murray.	_
I	_
learned	_
so	_
much	_
from	_
her.	_
After	_
the	_
curator	_
Robert	_
Storr	_
selected	_
all	_
the	_
paintings	_
from	_
her	_
lifetime	_
body	_
of	_
work,	_
I	_
loved	_
looking	_
at	_
the	_
paintings	_
from	_
the	_
1970s.	_
There	_
were	_
some	_
motifs	_
and	_
elements	_
that	_
would	_
come	_
up	_
again	_
later	_
in	_
her	_
life.	_
I	_
remember	_
asking	_
her	_
what	_
she	_
thought	_
of	_
those	_
early	_
works.	_
If	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
you	_
didn't	_
know	_
they	_
were	_
hers,	_
you	_
might	_
not	_
have	_
been	_
able	_
to	_
guess.	_
She	_
told	_
me	_
that	_
a	_
few	_
didn't	_
quite	_
meet	_
her	_
own	_
mark	_
for	_
what	_
she	_
wanted	_
them	_
to	_
be.	_
One	_
of	_
the	_
works,	_
in	Expansion.Instantiation
fact,	Expansion.Instantiation
so	_
didn't	_
meet	_
her	_
mark,	_
she	_
had	_
set	_
it	_
out	_
in	_
the	_
trash	_
in	_
her	_
studio,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
her	_
neighbor	_
had	_
taken	_
it	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
she	_
saw	_
its	_
value.	_
In	_
that	_
moment,	_
my	_
view	_
of	_
success	_
and	_
creativity	_
changed.	_
I	_
realized	_
that	_
success	_
is	_
a	_
moment,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
what	_
we're	_
always	_
celebrating	_
is	_
creativity	_
and	_
mastery.	_
But	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
this	_
is	_
the	_
thing:	_
What	_
gets	_
us	_
to	_
convert	_
success	_
into	_
mastery?	_
This	_
is	_
a	_
question	_
I've	_
long	_
asked	_
myself.	_
I	_
think	_
it	_
comes	_
when	_
we	_
start	_
to	_
value	_
the	_
gift	_
of	_
a	_
near	_
win.	_
I	_
started	_
to	_
understand	_
this	_
when	Temporal.Synchronous
I	_
went	_
on	_
one	_
cold	_
May	_
day	_
to	_
watch	_
a	_
set	_
of	_
varsity	_
archers,	_
all	_
women	_
as	_
fate	_
would	_
have	_
it,	_
at	_
the	_
northern	_
tip	_
of	_
Manhattan	_
at	_
Columbia's	_
Baker	_
Athletics	_
Complex.	_
I	_
wanted	_
to	_
see	_
what's	_
called	_
archer's	_
paradox,	_
the	_
idea	_
that	_
in	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal
order	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal
to	_
actually	_
hit	_
your	_
target,	_
you	_
have	_
to	_
aim	_
at	_
something	_
slightly	_
skew	_
from	_
it.	_
I	_
stood	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
watched	_
as	Temporal.Synchronous
the	_
coach	_
drove	_
up	_
these	_
women	_
in	_
this	_
gray	_
van,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
they	_
exited	_
with	_
this	_
kind	_
of	_
relaxed	_
focus.	_
One	_
held	_
a	_
half-eaten	_
ice	_
cream	_
cone	_
in	_
one	_
hand	_
and	_
arrows	_
in	_
the	_
left	_
with	_
yellow	_
fletching.	_
And	Expansion.Conjunction
they	_
passed	_
me	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction|Temporal.Synchronous
smiled,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
they	_
sized	_
me	_
up	_
as	Temporal.Synchronous
they	_
made	_
their	_
way	_
to	_
the	_
turf,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction|Temporal.Synchronous
spoke	_
to	_
each	_
other	_
not	_
with	_
words	_
but	Expansion.Substitution.Arg2-as-subst
with	_
numbers,	_
degrees,	_
I	_
thought,	_
positions	_
for	_
how	_
they	_
might	_
plan	_
to	_
hit	_
their	_
target.	_
I	_
stood	_
behind	_
one	_
archer	_
as	Temporal.Synchronous
her	_
coach	_
stood	_
in	_
between	_
us	_
to	_
maybe	_
assess	_
who	_
might	_
need	_
support,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
watched	_
her,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
I	_
didn't	_
understand	_
how	_
even	_
one	_
was	_
going	_
to	_
hit	_
the	_
ten	_
ring.	_
The	_
ten	_
ring	_
from	_
the	_
standard	_
75-yard	_
distance,	_
it	_
looks	_
as	_
small	_
as	_
a	_
matchstick	_
tip	_
held	_
out	_
at	_
arm's	_
length.	_
And	Expansion.Conjunction
this	_
is	_
while	_
holding	_
50	_
pounds	_
of	_
draw	_
weight	_
on	_
each	_
shot.	_
She	_
first	_
hit	_
a	_
seven,	_
I	_
remember,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
then	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence
a	_
nine,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
then	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence
two	_
tens,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
then	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence
the	_
next	_
arrow	_
didn't	_
even	_
hit	_
the	_
target.	_
And	Expansion.Conjunction
I	_
saw	_
that	_
gave	_
her	_
more	_
tenacity,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
she	_
went	_
after	_
it	_
again	_
and	_
again.	_
For	_
three	_
hours	_
this	_
went	_
on.	_
At	_
the	_
end	_
of	_
the	_
practice,	_
one	_
of	_
the	_
archers	_
was	_
so	_
taxed	_
that	_
she	_
lied	_
out	_
on	_
the	_
ground	_
just	_
star-fished,	_
her	_
head	_
looking	_
up	_
at	_
the	_
sky,	_
trying	_
to	_
find	_
what	_
T.S.	_
Eliot	_
might	_
call	_
that	_
still	_
point	_
of	_
the	_
turning	_
world.	_
It's	_
so	_
rare	_
in	_
American	_
culture,	_
there's	_
so	_
little	_
that's	_
vocational	_
about	_
it	_
anymore,	_
to	_
look	_
at	_
what	_
doggedness	_
looks	_
like	_
with	_
this	_
level	_
of	_
exactitude,	_
what	_
it	_
means	_
to	_
align	_
your	_
body	_
posture	_
for	_
three	_
hours	_
in	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal
order	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal
to	_
hit	_
a	_
target,	_
pursuing	_
a	_
kind	_
of	_
excellence	_
in	_
obscurity.	_
But	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
I	_
stayed	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
I	_
realized	_
I	_
was	_
witnessing	_
what's	_
so	_
rare	_
to	_
glimpse,	_
that	_
difference	_
between	_
success	_
and	_
mastery.	_
So	_
success	_
is	_
hitting	_
that	_
ten	_
ring,	_
but	Comparison.Contrast
mastery	_
is	_
knowing	_
that	_
it	_
means	_
nothing	_
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
you	_
can't	_
do	_
it	_
again	_
and	_
again.	_
Mastery	_
is	_
not	_
just	_
the	_
same	_
as	_
excellence,	_
though.	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
It's	_
not	_
the	_
same	_
as	_
success,	_
which	_
I	_
see	_
as	_
an	_
event,	_
a	_
moment	_
in	_
time,	_
and	_
a	_
label	_
that	_
the	_
world	_
confers	_
upon	_
you.	_
Mastery	_
is	_
not	_
a	_
commitment	_
to	_
a	_
goal	_
but	Expansion.Substitution.Arg2-as-subst
to	_
a	_
constant	_
pursuit.	_
What	_
gets	_
us	_
to	_
do	_
this,	_
what	_
get	_
us	_
to	_
forward	_
thrust	_
more	_
is	_
to	_
value	_
the	_
near	_
win.	_
How	_
many	_
times	_
have	_
we	_
designated	_
something	_
a	_
classic,	_
a	_
masterpiece	_
even,	_
while	Temporal.Synchronous
its	_
creator	_
considers	_
it	_
hopelessly	_
unfinished,	_
riddled	_
with	_
difficulties	_
and	_
flaws,	_
in	_
other	_
words,	_
a	_
near	_
win?	_
Elizabeth	_
Murray	_
surprised	_
me	_
with	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
her	_
admission	_
about	_
her	_
earlier	_
paintings.	_
Painter	_
Paul	_
Cézanne	_
so	_
often	_
thought	_
his	_
works	_
were	_
incomplete	_
that	_
he	_
would	_
deliberately	_
leave	_
them	_
aside	_
with	_
the	_
intention	_
of	_
picking	_
them	_
back	_
up	_
again,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
at	_
the	_
end	_
of	_
his	_
life,	_
the	_
result	_
was	_
that	_
he	_
had	_
only	_
signed	_
10	_
percent	_
of	_
his	_
paintings.	_
His	_
favorite	_
novel	_
was	_
"The	_
[Unknown]	_
Masterpiece"	_
by	_
Honoré	_
de	_
Balzac,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
he	_
felt	_
the	_
protagonist	_
was	_
the	_
painter	_
himself.	_
Franz	_
Kafka	_
saw	_
incompletion	_
when	Comparison.Contrast
others	_
would	_
find	_
only	_
works	_
to	_
praise,	_
so	Contingency.Cause.Result
much	Contingency.Cause.Result
so	Contingency.Cause.Result
that	_
he	_
wanted	_
all	_
of	_
his	_
diaries,	_
manuscripts,	_
letters	_
and	_
even	_
sketches	_
burned	_
upon	_
his	_
death.	_
His	_
friend	_
refused	_
to	_
honor	_
the	_
request,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
because	Contingency.Cause.Result
of	Contingency.Cause.Result
that,	Contingency.Cause.Result
we	_
now	_
have	_
all	_
the	_
works	_
we	_
now	_
do	_
by	_
Kafka:	_
"America,"	_
"The	_
Trial"	_
and	_
"The	_
Castle,"	_
a	_
work	_
so	_
incomplete	_
it	_
even	_
stops	_
mid-sentence.	_
The	_
pursuit	_
of	_
mastery,	_
in	_
other	_
words,	_
is	_
an	_
ever-onward	_
almost.	_
"Lord,	_
grant	_
that	_
I	_
desire	_
more	_
than	_
I	_
can	_
accomplish,"	_
Michelangelo	_
implored,	_
as	_
if	_
to	_
that	_
Old	_
Testament	_
God	_
on	_
the	_
Sistine	_
Chapel,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
he	_
himself	_
was	_
that	_
Adam	_
with	_
his	_
finger	_
outstretched	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
not	_
quite	_
touching	_
that	_
God's	_
hand.	_
Mastery	_
is	_
in	_
the	_
reaching,	_
not	Expansion.Substitution.Arg1-as-subst
the	_
arriving.	_
It's	_
in	_
constantly	_
wanting	_
to	_
close	_
that	_
gap	_
between	_
where	_
you	_
are	_
and	_
where	_
you	_
want	_
to	_
be.	_
Mastery	_
is	_
about	_
sacrificing	_
for	_
your	_
craft	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
not	Expansion.Substitution.Arg1-as-subst
for	_
the	_
sake	_
of	_
crafting	_
your	_
career.	_
How	_
many	_
inventors	_
and	_
untold	_
entrepreneurs	_
live	_
out	_
this	_
phenomenon?	_
We	_
see	_
it	_
even	_
in	_
the	_
life	_
of	_
the	_
indomitable	_
Arctic	_
explorer	_
Ben	_
Saunders,	_
who	_
tells	_
me	_
that	_
his	_
triumphs	_
are	_
not	_
merely	_
the	_
result	_
of	_
a	_
grand	_
achievement,	_
but	Comparison.Contrast
of	_
the	_
propulsion	_
of	_
a	_
lineage	_
of	_
near	_
wins.	_
We	_
thrive	_
when	_
we	_
stay	_
at	_
our	_
own	_
leading	_
edge.	_
It's	_
a	_
wisdom	_
understood	_
by	_
Duke	_
Ellington,	_
who	_
said	_
that	_
his	_
favorite	_
song	_
out	_
of	_
his	_
repertoire	_
was	_
always	_
the	_
next	_
one,	_
always	_
the	_
one	_
he	_
had	_
yet	_
to	_
compose.	_
Part	_
of	_
the	_
reason	_
that	_
the	_
near	_
win	_
is	_
inbuilt	_
to	_
mastery	_
is	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
the	_
greater	_
our	_
proficiency,	_
the	_
more	_
clearly	_
we	_
might	_
see	_
that	_
we	_
don't	_
know	_
all	_
that	_
we	_
thought	_
we	_
did.	_
It's	_
called	_
the	_
Dunning–Kruger	_
effect.	_
The	_
Paris	_
Review	_
got	_
it	_
out	_
of	_
James	_
Baldwin	_
when	Temporal.Synchronous
they	_
asked	_
him,	_
"What	_
do	_
you	_
think	_
increases	_
with	_
knowledge?"	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
he	_
said,	_
"You	_
learn	_
how	_
little	_
you	_
know."	_
Success	_
motivates	_
us,	_
but	Comparison.Contrast
a	_
near	_
win	_
can	_
propel	_
us	_
in	_
an	_
ongoing	_
quest.	_
One	Expansion.Instantiation
of	Expansion.Instantiation
the	Expansion.Instantiation
most	Expansion.Instantiation
vivid	Expansion.Instantiation
examples	Expansion.Instantiation
of	Expansion.Instantiation
this	Expansion.Instantiation
comes	Expansion.Instantiation
when	_
we	_
look	_
at	_
the	_
difference	_
between	_
Olympic	_
silver	_
medalists	_
and	_
bronze	_
medalists	_
after	_
a	_
competition.	_
Thomas	_
Gilovich	_
and	_
his	_
team	_
from	_
Cornell	_
studied	_
this	_
difference	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
found	_
that	_
the	_
frustration	_
silver	_
medalists	_
feel	_
compared	_
to	_
bronze,	_
who	_
are	_
typically	_
a	_
bit	_
more	_
happy	_
to	_
have	_
just	_
not	_
received	_
fourth	_
place	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
not	_
medaled	_
at	_
all,	_
gives	_
silver	_
medalists	_
a	_
focus	_
on	_
follow-up	_
competition.	_
We	_
see	_
it	_
even	_
in	_
the	_
gambling	_
industry	_
that	_
once	_
picked	_
up	_
on	_
this	_
phenomenon	_
of	_
the	_
near	_
win	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
created	_
these	_
scratch-off	_
tickets	_
that	_
had	_
a	_
higher	_
than	_
average	_
rate	_
of	_
near	_
wins	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
so	Contingency.Cause.Result
compelled	_
people	_
to	_
buy	_
more	_
tickets	_
that	_
they	_
were	_
called	_
heart-stoppers,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
were	_
set	_
on	_
a	_
gambling	_
industry	_
set	_
of	_
abuses	_
in	_
Britain	_
in	_
the	_
1970s.	_
The	_
reason	_
the	_
near	_
win	_
has	_
a	_
propulsion	_
is	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
it	_
changes	_
our	_
view	_
of	_
the	_
landscape	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
puts	_
our	_
goals,	_
which	_
we	_
tend	_
to	_
put	_
at	_
a	_
distance,	_
into	_
more	_
proximate	_
vicinity	_
to	_
where	_
we	_
stand.	_
If	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
I	_
ask	_
you	_
to	_
envision	_
what	_
a	_
great	_
day	_
looks	_
like	_
next	_
week,	_
you	_
might	_

it	_
in	_

tomorrow,	_
you	_

And	Expansion.Conjunction
this	_
is	_
what	_
a	_

and	Expansion.Conjunction
it's	_
why	_
the	_
deliberate	_

is	_
inbuilt	_
into	_
creation	_
myths.	_
In	_
Navajo	_
culture,	_
some	_
craftsmen	_
and	_
women	_
would	_
deliberately	_
put	_
an	_
imperfection	_
in	_
textiles	_
and	_
ceramics.	_
It's	_
what's	_
called	_
a	_
spirit	_
line,	_
a	_
deliberate	_
flaw	_
in	_
the	_
pattern	_
to	_
give	_
the	_
weaver	_
or	_
maker	_
a	_
way	_
out,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
also	Expansion.Conjunction
a	_
reason	_
to	_
continue	_
making	_
work.	_
Masters	_
are	_
not	_
experts	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
they	_
take	_
a	_
subject	_
to	_
its	_
conceptual	_
end.	_
They're	_
masters	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
they	_
realize	_
that	_
there	_
isn't	_
one.	_
Now	_
it	_
occurred	_
to	_
me,	_
as	Temporal.Synchronous
I	_
thought	_
about	_
this,	_
why	_
the	_
archery	_
coach	_
told	_
me	_
at	_
the	_
end	_
of	_
that	_
practice,	_
out	_
of	_
earshot	_
of	_
his	_
archers,	_
that	_
he	_
and	_
his	_
colleagues	_
never	_
feel	_
they	_
can	_
do	_
enough	_
for	_
their	_
team,	_
never	_
feel	_
there	_
are	_
enough	_
visualization	_
techniques	_
and	_
posture	_
drills	_
to	_
help	_
them	_
overcome	_
those	_
constant	_
near	_
wins.	_
It	_
didn't	_
sound	_
like	_
a	_
complaint,	_
exactly,	_
but	Expansion.Substitution.Arg2-as-subst
just	_
a	_
way	_
to	_
let	_
me	_
know,	_
a	_
kind	_
of	_
tender	_
admission,	_
to	_
remind	_
me	_
that	_
he	_
knew	_
he	_
was	_
giving	_
himself	_
over	_
to	_
a	_
voracious,	_
unfinished	_
path	_
that	_
always	_
required	_
more.	_
We	_
build	_
out	_
of	_
the	_
unfinished	_
idea,	_
even	_
if	_
that	_
idea	_
is	_
our	_
former	_
self.	_
This	_
is	_
the	_
dynamic	_
of	_
mastery.	_
Coming	_
close	_
to	_
what	_
you	_
thought	_
you	_
wanted	_
can	_
help	_
you	_
attain	_
more	_
than	_
you	_
ever	_
dreamed	_
you	_
could.	_
It's	_
what	_
I	_
have	_
to	_
imagine	_
Elizabeth	_
Murray	_
was	_
thinking	_
when	Temporal.Synchronous
I	_
saw	_
her	_
smiling	_
at	_
those	_
early	_
paintings	_
one	_
day	_
in	_
the	_
galleries.	_
Even	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	_
created	_
utopias,	_
I	_
believe	_
we	_
would	_
still	_
have	_
the	_
incomplete.	_
Completion	_
is	_
a	_
goal,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
we	_
hope	_
it	_
is	_
never	_
the	_
end.	_
Thank	_
you.	_
