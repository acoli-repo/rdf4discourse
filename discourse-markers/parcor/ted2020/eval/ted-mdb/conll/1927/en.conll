McKnett:	_
The	_
investment	_
logic	_
for	_
sustainability	_
The	_
world	_
is	_
changing	_
in	_
some	_
really	_
profound	_
ways,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
I	_
worry	_
that	_
investors	_
aren't	_
paying	_
enough	_
attention	_
to	_
some	_
of	_
the	_
biggest	_
drivers	_
of	_
change,	_
especially	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
when	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
it	_
comes	_
to	_
sustainability.	_
And	_
by	_
sustainability,	_
I	_
mean	_
the	_
really	_
juicy	_
things,	_
like	_
environmental	_
and	_
social	_
issues	_
and	_
corporate	_
governance.	_
I	_
think	_
it's	_
reckless	_
to	_
ignore	_
these	_
things,	_
because	Contingency.Cause+Belief.Reason+Belief
doing	_
so	_
can	_
jeopardize	_
future	_
long-term	_
returns.	_
And	Expansion.Conjunction
here's	_
something	_
that	_
may	_
surprise	_
you:	_
the	_
balance	_
of	_
power	_
to	_
really	_
influence	_
sustainability	_
rests	_
with	_
institutional	_
investors,	_
the	_
large	_
investors	_
like	_
pension	_
funds,	_
foundations	_
and	_
endowments.	_
I	_
believe	_
that	_
sustainable	_
investing	_
is	_
less	_
complicated	_
than	_
you	_
think,	_
better-performing	_
than	_
you	_
believe,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
more	_
important	_
than	_
we	_
can	_
imagine.	_
Let	_
me	_
remind	_
you	_
what	_
we	_
already	_
know.	_
We	_
have	_
a	_
population	_
that's	_
both	_
growing	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
aging;	_
we	_
have	_
seven	_
billion	_
souls	_
today	_
heading	_
to	_
10	_
billion	_
at	_
the	_
end	_
of	_
the	_
century;	_
we	_
consume	_
natural	_
resources	_
faster	_
than	_
they	_
can	_
be	_
replenished;	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
the	_
emissions	_
that	_
are	_
mainly	_
responsible	_
for	_
climate	_
change	_
just	_
keep	_
increasing.	_
Now	_
clearly,	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
these	_
are	_
environmental	_
and	_
social	_
issues,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
that's	_
not	_
all.	_
They're	_
economic	_
issues,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
that	_
makes	_
them	_
relevant	_
to	_
risk	_
and	_
return.	_
And	Expansion.Conjunction
they	_
are	_
really	_
complex	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
they	_
can	_
seem	_
really	_
far	_
off,	_
that	_
the	_
temptation	_
may	_
be	_
to	_
do	_
this:	_
bury	_
our	_
heads	_
in	_
the	_
sand	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction|Temporal.Synchronous
not	_
think	_
about	_
it.	_
Resist	_
this,	_
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
you	_
can.	_
Don't	_
do	_
this	_
at	_
home.	_
(Laughter)	_
But	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
it	_
makes	_
me	_
wonder	_
if	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
the	_
investment	_
rules	_
of	_
today	_
are	_
fit	_
for	_
purpose	_
tomorrow.	_
We	_
know	_
that	_
investors,	_
when	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond|Temporal.Synchronous
they	_
look	_
at	_
a	_
company	_
and	_
decide	_
whether	_
to	_
invest,	_
they	_
look	_
at	_
financial	_
data,	_
metrics	_
like	_
sales	_
growth,	_
cash	_
flow,	_
market	_
share,	_
valuation	_
--	_
you	_
know,	_
the	_
really	_
sexy	_
stuff.	_
And	Expansion.Conjunction
these	_
things	_
are	_
fundamental,	_
of	_
course,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
they're	_
not	_
enough.	_
Investors	_
should	_
also	Expansion.Conjunction
look	_
at	_
performance	_
metrics	_
in	_
what	_
we	_
call	_
ESG:	_
environment,	_
social	_
and	_
governance.	_
Environment	_
includes	_
energy	_
consumption,	_
water	_
availability,	_
waste	_
and	_
pollution,	_
just	_
making	_
efficient	_
uses	_
of	_
resources.	_
Social	_
includes	_
human	_
capital,	_
things	_
like	_
employee	_
engagement	_
and	_
innovation	_
capacity,	_
as	_
well	_
as	_
supply	_
chain	_
management	_
and	_
labor	_
rights	_
and	_
human	_
rights.	_
And	Expansion.Conjunction
governance	_
relates	_
to	_
the	_
oversight	_
of	_
companies	_
by	_
their	_
boards	_
and	_
investors.	_
See,	Contingency.Cause+SpeechAct.Result+SpeechAct
I	_
told	_
you	_
this	_
is	_
the	_
really	_
juicy	_
stuff.	_
But	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
ESG	_
is	_
the	_
measure	_
of	_
sustainability,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
sustainable	_
investing	_
incorporates	_
ESG	_
factors	_
with	_
financial	_
factors	_
into	_
the	_
investment	_
process.	_
It	Expansion.Equivalence
means	Expansion.Equivalence
limiting	_
future	_
risk	_
by	Expansion.Manner.Arg2-as-manner
minimizing	_
harm	_
to	_
people	_
and	_
planet,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
it	_
means	_
providing	_
capital	_
to	_
users	_
who	_
deploy	_
it	_
towards	_
productive	_
and	_
sustainable	_
outcomes.	_
So	Contingency.Cause+SpeechAct.Result+SpeechAct
if	Contingency.Condition+SpeechAct
sustainability	_
matters	_
financially	_
today,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
all	_
signs	_
indicate	_
more	_
tomorrow,	_
is	_
the	_
private	_
sector	_
paying	_
attention?	_
Well,	_
the	_
really	_
cool	_
thing	_
is	_
that	_
most	_
CEOs	_
are.	_
They	_
started	_
to	_
see	_
sustainability	_
not	_
just	_
as	_
important	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
crucial	_
to	_
business	_
success.	_
About	_
80	_
percent	_
of	_
global	_
CEOs	_
see	_
sustainability	_
as	Expansion.Manner.Arg2-as-manner
the	_
root	_
to	_
growth	_
in	_
innovation	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
leading	_
to	_
competitive	_
advantage	_
in	_
their	_
industries.	_
But	Comparison.Contrast
93	_
percent	_
see	_
ESG	_
as	_
the	_
future,	_
or	Expansion.Disjunction
as	_
important	_
to	_
the	_
future	_
of	_
their	_
business.	_
So	Contingency.Cause+SpeechAct.Result+SpeechAct
the	_
views	_
of	_
CEOs	_
are	_
clear.	_
There's	_
tremendous	_
opportunity	_
in	_
sustainability.	_
So	Contingency.Cause+SpeechAct.Result+SpeechAct
how	Expansion.Manner.Arg2-as-manner|Hypophora
are	_
companies	_
actually	_
leveraging	_
ESG	_
to	_
drive	_
hard	_
business	_
results?	_
One	Expansion.Instantiation
example	Expansion.Instantiation
is	Expansion.Instantiation
near	Expansion.Instantiation
and	Expansion.Instantiation
dear	Expansion.Instantiation
to	Expansion.Instantiation
our	Expansion.Instantiation
hearts.	Expansion.Instantiation
In	_
2012,	_
State	_
Street	_
migrated	_
54	_
applications	_
to	_
the	_
cloud	_
environment,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
we	_
retired	_
another	_
85.	_
We	_
virtualized	_
our	_
operating	_
system	_
environments,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
we	_
completed	_
numerous	_
automation	_
projects.	_
Now	Contingency.Cause.Result
these	_
initiatives	_
create	_
a	_
more	_
mobile	_
workplace,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
they	_
reduce	_
our	_
real	_
estate	_
footprint,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
they	_
yield	_
savings	_
of	_
23	_
million	_
dollars	_
in	_
operating	_
costs	_
annually,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
avoid	_
the	_
emissions	_
of	_
a	_
100,000	_
metric	_
tons	_
of	_
carbon.	_
That's	Expansion.Equivalence
the	Expansion.Equivalence
equivalent	Expansion.Equivalence
of	Expansion.Equivalence
taking	_
21,000	_
cars	_
off	_
the	_
road.	_
So	Contingency.Cause+SpeechAct.Result+SpeechAct
awesome,	_
right?	_
Another	_
example	_
is	_
Pentair.	_
Pentair	_
is	_
a	_
U.S.	_
industrial	_
conglomerate,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
about	Temporal.Asynchronous.Succession
a	Temporal.Asynchronous.Succession
decade	Temporal.Asynchronous.Succession
ago,	Temporal.Asynchronous.Succession
they	_
sold	_
their	_
core	_
power	_
tools	_
business	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
reinvested	_
those	_
proceeds	_
in	_
a	_
water	_
business.	_
That's	_
a	_
really	_
big	_
bet.	_
Why	Hypophora
did	_
they	_
do	_
that?	_
Well,	_
with	_
apologies	_
to	_
the	_
Home	_
Improvement	_
fans,	_
there's	_
more	_
growth	_
in	_
water	_
than	_
in	_
power	_
tools,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
this	_
company	_
has	_
their	_
sights	_
set	_
on	_
what	_
they	_
call	_
"the	_
new	_
New	_
World."	_
That's	_
four	_
billion	_
middle	_
class	_
people	_
demanding	_
food,	_
energy	_
and	_
water.	_
Now,	_
you	_
may	_
be	_
asking	_
yourself,	_
are	_
these	_
just	_
isolated	_
cases?	_
I	_
mean,	_
come	_
on,	_
really?	_
Do	Hypophora
companies	_
that	_
take	_
sustainability	_
into	_
account	_
really	_
do	_
well	_
financially?	_
The	_
answer	_
that	_
may	_
surprise	_
you	_
is	_
yes.	_
The	_
data	_
shows	_
that	_
stocks	_
with	_
better	_
ESG	_
performance	_
perform	_
just	_
as	_
well	_
as	_
others.	_
In	_
blue,	_
we	_
see	_
the	_
MSCI	_
World.	_
It's	_
an	_
index	_
of	_
large	_
companies	_
from	_
developed	_
markets	_
across	_
the	_
world.	_
And	Comparison.Contrast
in	_
gold,	_
we	_
see	_
a	_
subset	_
of	_
companies	_
rated	_
as	_
having	_
the	_
best	_
ESG	_
performance.	_
Over	_
three	_
plus	_
years,	_
no	_
performance	_
tradeoff.	_
So	Contingency.Cause+SpeechAct.Result+SpeechAct
that's	_
okay,	_
right?	_
We	_
want	_
more.	_
I	_
want	_
more.	_
In	_
some	_
cases,	_
there	_
may	_
be	_
outperformance	_
from	_
ESG.	_
In	_
blue,	_
we	_
see	_
the	_
performance	_
of	_
the	_
500	_
largest	_
global	_
companies,	_
and	Comparison.Contrast
in	_
gold,	_
we	_
see	_
a	_
subset	_
of	_
companies	_
with	_
best	_
practice	_
in	_
climate	_
change	_
strategy	_
and	_
risk	_
management.	_
Now	_
over	_
almost	_
eight	_
years,	_
they've	_
outperformed	_
by	_
about	_
two	_
thirds.	_
So	_
yes,	_
this	_
is	_
correlation.	_
It's	_
not	_
causation.	_
But	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
it	_
does	_
illustrate	_
that	_
environmental	_
leadership	_
is	_
compatible	_
with	_
good	_
returns.	_
So	_
if	Contingency.Condition+SpeechAct
the	_
returns	_
are	_
the	_
same	_
or	_
better	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
the	_
planet	_
benefits,	_
wouldn't	_
this	_
be	_
the	_
norm?	_
Are	Hypophora
investors,	_
particularly	_
institutional	_
investors,	_
engaged?	_
Well,	_
some	_
are,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
a	_
few	_
are	_
really	_
at	_
the	_
vanguard.	_
Hesta.	_
Hesta	_
is	_
a	_
retirement	_
fund	_
for	_
health	_
and	_
community	_
services	_
employees	_
in	_
Australia,	_
with	_
assets	_
of	_
22	_
billion	_
[dollars].	_
They	_
believe	_
that	_
ESG	_
has	_
the	_
potential	_
to	_
impact	_
risks	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
returns,	_
so	Contingency.Cause.Result
incorporating	_
it	_
into	_
the	_
investment	_
process	_
is	_
core	_
to	_
their	_
duty	_
to	_
act	_
in	_
the	_
best	_
interest	_
of	_
fund	_
members,	_
core	_
to	_
their	_
duty.	_
You	_
gotta	_
love	_
the	_
Aussies,	_
right?	_
CalPERS	_
is	_
another	_
example.	_
CalPERS	_
is	_
the	_
pension	_
fund	_
for	_
public	_
employees	_
in	_
California,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
with	_
assets	_
of	_
244	_
billion	_
[dollars],	_
they	_
are	_
the	_
second	_
largest	_
in	_
the	_
U.S.	_
and	_
the	_
sixth	_
largest	_
in	_
the	_
world.	_
Now,	_
they're	_
moving	_
toward	_
100	_
percent	_
sustainable	_
investment	_
by	Expansion.Manner.Arg2-as-manner
systematically	_
integrated	_
ESG	_
across	_
the	_
entire	_
fund.	_
Why?	_
They	_
believe	_
it's	_
critical	_
to	_
superior	_
long-term	_
returns,	_
full	_
stop.	_
In	_
their	_
own	_
words,	_
"long-term	_
value	_
creation	_
requires	_
the	_
effective	_
management	_
of	_
three	_
forms	_
of	_
capital:	_
financial,	_
human,	_
and	_
physical.	_
This	Contingency.Cause+Belief.Result+Belief
is	Contingency.Cause+Belief.Result+Belief
why	Contingency.Cause+Belief.Result+Belief
we	_
are	_
concerned	_
with	_
ESG."	_
Now,	_
I	_
do	_
speak	_
to	_
a	_
lot	_
of	_
investors	_
as	_
part	_
of	_
my	_
job,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
not	_
all	_
of	_
them	_
see	_
it	_
this	_
way.	_
Often	_
I	_
hear,	_
"We	_
are	_
required	_
to	_
maximize	_
returns,	_
so	Contingency.Cause.Result
we	_
don't	_
do	_
that	_
here,"	_
or,	Expansion.Disjunction
"We	_
don't	_
want	_
to	_
use	_
the	_
portfolio	_
to	_
make	_
policy	_
statements."	_
The	_
one	_
that	_
just	_
really	_
gets	_
under	_
my	_
skin	_
is,	_
"If	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
you	_
want	_
to	_
do	_
something	_
about	_
that,	_
just	_
make	_
money,	_
give	_
the	_
profits	_
to	_
charities."	_
It's	_
eyes	_
rolling,	_
eyes	_
rolling.	_
I	_
mean,	_
let	_
me	_
clarify	_
something	_
right	_
here.	_
Companies	_
and	_
investors	_
are	_
not	_
singularly	_
responsible	_
for	_
the	_
fate	_
of	_
the	_
planet.	_
They	_
don't	_
have	_
indefinite	_
social	_
obligations,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
prudent	_
investing	_
and	_
finance	_
theory	_
aren't	_
subordinate	_
to	_
sustainability.	_
They're	_
compatible.	_
So	Contingency.Cause+Belief.Result+Belief
I'm	_
not	_
talking	_
about	_
tradeoffs	_
here.	_
But	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
institutional	_
investors	_
are	_
the	_
x-factor	_
in	_
sustainability.	_
Why	_
do	_
they	_
hold	_
the	_
key?	_
The	_
answer,	_
quite	_
simply,	_
is,	_
they	_
have	_
the	_
money.	_
(Laughter)	_
A	_
lot	_
of	_
it.	_
I	Expansion.Substitution.Arg2-as-subst
mean,	Expansion.Substitution.Arg2-as-subst
a	_
really	_
lot	_
of	_
it.	_
The	_
global	_
stock	_
market	_
is	_
worth	_
55	_
trillion	_
dollars.	_
The	_
global	_
bond	_
market,	_
78	_
trillion.	_
That's	_
133	_
trillion	_
combined.	_
That's	_
eight	_
and	_
a	_
half	_
times	_
the	_
GDP	_
of	_
the	_
U.S.	_
That's	_
the	_
world's	_
largest	_
economy.	_
That's	_
some	_
serious	_
freaking	_
firepower.	_
So	_
we	_
can	_
reconsider	_
some	_
of	_
these	_
pressing	_
challenges,	_
like	_
fresh	_
water,	_
clean	_
air,	_
feeding	_
10	_
billion	_
mouths,	_
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
institutional	_
investors	_
integrated	_
ESG	_
into	_
investment.	_
What	_
if	_
they	_
used	_
that	_
firepower	_
to	_
allocate	_
more	_
of	_
their	_
capital	_
to	_
companies	_
working	_
the	_
hardest	_
at	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
solving	_
these	_
challenges	_
or	Expansion.Disjunction
at	_
least	_
not	_
exacerbating	_
them?	_
What	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	_
work	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
save	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
invest,	_
only	_
to	_
find	_
that	_
the	_
world	_
we	_
retire	_
into	_
is	_
more	_
stressed	_
and	_
less	_
secure	_
than	_
it	_
is	_
now?	_
What	_
if	_
there	_
isn't	_
enough	_
clean	_
air	_
and	_
fresh	_
water?	_
Now	_
a	_
fair	_
question	_
might	_
be,	_
what	Hypophora
if	Hypophora
all	_
this	_
sustainability	_
risk	_
stuff	_
is	_
exaggerated,	_
overstated,	_
it's	_
not	_
urgent,	_
something	_
for	_
virtuous	_
consumers	_
or	_
lifestyle	_
choice?	_
Well,	_
President	_
John	_
F.	_
Kennedy	_
said	_
something	_
about	_
this	_
that	_
is	_
just	_
spot	_
on:	_
"There	_
are	_
risks	_
and	_
costs	_
to	_
a	_
program	_
of	_
action,	_
but	Comparison.Contrast
they	_
are	_
far	_
less	_
than	_
the	_
long-range	_
risks	_
and	_
costs	_
of	_
comfortable	_
inaction."	_
I	_
can	_
appreciate	_
that	_
there	_
is	_
estimation	_
risk	_

my	_

that	_
we	_

Good,	_
