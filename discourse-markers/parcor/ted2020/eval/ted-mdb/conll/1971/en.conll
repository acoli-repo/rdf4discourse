The	_
sore	_
problem	_
of	_
prosthetic	_
limbs	_
I	_
was	_
born	_
and	_
raised	_
in	_
Sierra	_
Leone,	_
a	_
small	_
and	_
very	_
beautiful	_
country	_
in	_
West	_
Africa,	_
a	_
country	_
rich	_
both	_
in	_
physical	_
resources	_
and	_
creative	_
talent.	_
However,	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
Sierra	_
Leone	_
is	_
infamous	_
for	_
a	_
decade-long	_
rebel	_
war	_
in	_
the	_
'90s	_
when	_
entire	_
villages	_
were	_
burnt	_
down.	_
An	_
estimated	_
8,000	_
men,	_
women	_
and	_
children	_
had	_
their	_
arms	_
and	_
legs	_
amputated	_
during	_
this	_
time.	_
As	Temporal.Synchronous
my	_
family	_
and	_
I	_
ran	_
for	_
safety	_
when	_
I	_
was	_
about	_
12	_
from	_
one	_
of	_
those	_
attacks,	_
I	_
resolved	_
that	_
I	_
would	_
do	_
everything	_
I	_
could	_
to	_
ensure	_
that	_
my	_
own	_
children	_
would	_
not	_
go	_
through	_
the	_
same	_
experiences	_
we	_
had.	_
They	_
would,	_
in	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
fact,	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
be	_
part	_
of	_
a	_
Sierra	_
Leone	_
where	_
war	_
and	_
amputation	_
were	_
no	_
longer	_
a	_
strategy	_
for	_
gaining	_
power.	_
As	Temporal.Synchronous
I	_
watched	_
people	_
who	_
I	_
knew,	_
loved	_
ones,	_
recover	_
from	_
this	_
devastation,	_
one	_
thing	_
that	_
deeply	_
troubled	_
me	_
was	_
that	_
many	_
of	_
the	_
amputees	_
in	_
the	_
country	_
would	_
not	_
use	_
their	_
prostheses.	_
The	Contingency.Cause.Reason
reason,	Contingency.Cause.Reason
I	Contingency.Cause.Reason
would	Contingency.Cause.Reason
come	Contingency.Cause.Reason
to	Contingency.Cause.Reason
find	Contingency.Cause.Reason
out,	Contingency.Cause.Reason
was	Contingency.Cause.Reason
that	_
their	_
prosthetic	_
sockets	_
were	_
painful	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
they	_
did	_
not	_
fit	_
well.	_
The	_
prosthetic	_
socket	_
is	_
the	_
part	_
in	_
which	_
the	_
amputee	_
inserts	_
their	_
residual	_
limb,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
which	_
connects	_
to	_
the	_
prosthetic	_
ankle.	_
Even	_
in	_
the	_
developed	_
world,	_
it	_
takes	_
a	_
period	_
of	_
three	_
weeks	_
to	_
often	_
years	_
for	_
a	_
patient	_
to	_
get	_
a	_
comfortable	_
socket,	_
if	_
ever.	_
Prosthetists	_
still	_
use	_
conventional	_
processes	_
like	_
molding	_
and	_
casting	_
to	_
create	_
single-material	_
prosthetic	_
sockets.	_
Such	_
sockets	_
often	_
leave	_
intolerable	_
amounts	_
of	_
pressure	_
on	_
the	_
limbs	_
of	_
the	_
patient,	_
leaving	_
them	_
with	_
pressure	_
sores	_
and	_
blisters.	_
It	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
does	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
not	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
matter	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
how	_
powerful	_
your	_
prosthetic	_
ankle	_
is.	_
If	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
your	_
prosthetic	_
socket	_
is	_
uncomfortable,	_
you	_
will	_
not	_
use	_
your	_
leg,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
that	_
is	_
just	_
simply	_
unacceptable	_
in	_
our	_
age.	_
So	_
one	_
day,	_
when	Temporal.Synchronous
I	_
met	_
professor	_
Hugh	_
Herr	_
about	_
two	_
and	_
a	_
half	_
years	_
ago,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
he	_
asked	_
me	_
if	_
I	_
knew	_
how	_
to	_
solve	_
this	_
problem,	_
I	_
said,	_
"No,	_
not	_
yet,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
I	_
would	_
love	_
to	_
figure	_
it	_
out."	_
And	Expansion.Conjunction
so,	Contingency.Cause.Result
for	_
my	_
Ph.D.	_
at	_
the	_
MIT	_
Media	_
Lab,	_
I	_
designed	_
custom	_
prosthetic	_
sockets	_
quickly	_
and	_
cheaply	_
that	_
are	_
more	_
comfortable	_
than	_
conventional	_
prostheses.	_
I	_
used	_
magnetic	_
resonance	_
imaging	_
to	_
capture	_
the	_
actual	_
shape	_
of	_
the	_
patient's	_
anatomy,	_
then	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence
use	_
finite	_
element	_
modeling	_
to	_
better	_
predict	_
the	_
internal	_
stresses	_
and	_
strains	_
on	_
the	_
normal	_
forces,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
then	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence
create	_
a	_
prosthetic	_
socket	_
for	_
manufacture.	_
We	_
use	_
a	_
3D	_
printer	_
to	_
create	_
a	_
multi-material	_
prosthetic	_
socket	_
which	_
relieves	_
pressure	_
where	_
needed	_
on	_
the	_
anatomy	_
of	_
the	_
patient.	_
In	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg1-as-detail
short,	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg1-as-detail
we're	_
using	_
data	_
to	_
make	_
novel	_
sockets	_
quickly	_
and	_
cheaply.	_
In	_
a	_
recent	_
trial	_
we	_
just	_
wrapped	_
up	_
at	_
the	_
Media	_
Lab,	_
one	_
of	_
our	_
patients,	_
a	_
U.S.	_
veteran	_
who	_
has	_
been	_
an	_
amputee	_
for	_
about	_
20	_
years	_
and	_
worn	_
dozens	_
of	_
legs,	_
said	_
of	_
one	_
of	_
our	_
printed	_
parts,	_
"It's	_
so	_
soft,	_
it's	_
like	_
walking	_
on	_
pillows,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
it's	_
effing	_
sexy."	_
(Laughter)	_
Disability	_
in	_
our	_
age	_
should	_
not	_
prevent	_
anyone	_
from	_
living	_
meaningful	_
lives.	_
My	_
hope	_
and	_
desire	_
is	_
that	_
the	_
tools	_
and	_
processes	_
we	_
develop	_
in	_
our	_
research	_
group	_
can	_
be	_
used	_
to	_
bring	_
highly	_
functional	_
prostheses	_
to	_
those	_
who	_
need	_
them.	_
For	_
me,	_
a	_
place	_
to	_
begin	_
healing	_
the	_
souls	_
of	_
those	_
affected	_
by	_
war	_
and	_
disease	_
is	_
by	_
creating	_
comfortable	_
and	_
affordable	_
interfaces	_
for	_
their	_
bodies.	_
Whether	_
it's	_
in	_
Sierra	_
Leone	_
or	Expansion.Disjunction
in	_
Boston,	_
I	_
hope	_
this	_
not	_
only	_
restores	_
but	Expansion.Conjunction
indeed	Expansion.Conjunction
transforms	_
their	_
sense	_
of	_
human	_
potential.	_
Thank	_
you	_
very	_
much.	_
