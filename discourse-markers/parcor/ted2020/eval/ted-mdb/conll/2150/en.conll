Social	_
maps	_
that	_
reveal	_
a	_
city's	_
intersections	_
and	_
separations	_
When	Temporal.Synchronous
we	_
think	_
about	_
mapping	_
cities,	_
we	_
tend	_
to	_
think	_
about	_
roads	_
and	_
streets	_
and	_
buildings,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
the	_
settlement	_
narrative	_
that	_
led	_
to	_
their	_
creation,	_
or	Expansion.Disjunction
you	_
might	_
think	_
about	_
the	_
bold	_
vision	_
of	_
an	_
urban	_
designer,	_
but	Comparison.Contrast
there's	_
other	_
ways	_
to	_
think	_
about	_
mapping	_
cities	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
how	_
they	_
got	_
to	_
be	_
made.	_
Today,	_
I	_
want	_
to	_
show	_
you	_
a	_
new	_
kind	_
of	_
map.	_
This	_
is	_
not	_
a	_
geographic	_
map.	_
This	_
is	_
a	_
map	_
of	_
the	_
relationships	_
between	_
people	_
in	_
my	_
hometown	_
of	_
Baltimore,	_
Maryland,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
what	_
you	_
can	_
see	_
here	_
is	_
that	_
each	_
dot	_
represents	_
a	_
person,	_
each	_
line	_
represents	_
a	_
relationship	_
between	_
those	_
people,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
each	_
color	_
represents	_
a	_
community	_
within	_
the	_
network.	_
Now,	_
I'm	_
here	_
on	_
the	_
green	_
side,	_
down	_
on	_
the	_
far	_
right	_
where	_
the	_
geeks	_
are,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
TEDx	_
also	Comparison.Similarity
is	_
down	_
on	_
the	_
far	_
right.	_
(Laughter)	_
Now,	_
on	_
the	_
other	_
side	_
of	_
the	_
network,	_
you	_
tend	_
to	_
have	_
primarily	_
African-American	_
and	_
Latino	_
folks	_
who	_
are	_
really	_
concerned	_
about	_
somewhat	_
different	_
things	_
than	Comparison.Contrast
the	_
geeks	_
are,	_
but	_
just	_
to	_
give	_
some	_
sense,	_
the	_
green	_
part	_
of	_
the	_
network	_
we	_
call	_
Smalltimore,	_
for	_
those	_
of	_
us	_
that	_
inhabit	_
it,	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
it	_
seems	_
as	_
though	_
we're	_
living	_
in	_
a	_
very	_
small	_
town.	_
We	_
see	_
the	_
same	_
people	_
over	_
and	_
over	_
again,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
that's	Contingency.Cause.Reason
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
we're	_
not	_
really	_
exploring	_
the	_
full	_
depth	_
and	_
breadth	_
of	_
the	_
city.	_
On	_
the	_
other	_
end	_
of	_
the	_
network,	_
you	_
have	_
folks	_
who	_
are	_
interested	_
in	_
things	_
like	_
hip-hop	_
music	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
they	_
even	_
identify	_
with	_
living	_
in	_
the	_
DC/Maryland/Virginia	_
area	_
over,	Expansion.Substitution.Arg1-as-subst
say,	_
the	_
Baltimore	_
city	_
designation	_
proper.	_
But	Comparison.Contrast
in	_
the	_
middle,	_
you	_
see	_
that	_
there's	_
something	_
that	_
connects	_
the	_
two	_
communities	_
together,	_
and	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
that's	_
sports.	_
We	_
have	_
the	_
Baltimore	_
Orioles,	_
the	_
Baltimore	_
Ravens	_
football	_
team,	_
Michael	_
Phelps,	_
the	_
Olympian.	_
Under	_
Armour,	_
you	_
may	_
have	_
heard	_
of,	_
is	_
a	_
Baltimore	_
company,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
that	_
community	_
of	_
sports	_
acts	_
as	_
the	_
only	_
bridge	_
between	_
these	_
two	_
ends	_
of	_
the	_
network.	_
Let's	_
take	_
a	_
look	_
at	_
San	_
Francisco.	_
You	_
see	_
something	_
a	_
little	_
bit	_
different	_
happening	_
in	_
San	_
Francisco.	_
On	Comparison.Contrast
the	Comparison.Contrast
one	Comparison.Contrast
hand,	Comparison.Contrast
you	Comparison.Contrast
do	Comparison.Contrast
have	Comparison.Contrast
the	Comparison.Contrast
media,	Comparison.Contrast
politics	Comparison.Contrast
and	Comparison.Contrast
news	Comparison.Contrast
lobe	Comparison.Contrast
that	Comparison.Contrast
tends	Comparison.Contrast
to	Comparison.Contrast
exist	Comparison.Contrast
in	Comparison.Contrast
Baltimore	Comparison.Contrast
and	Comparison.Contrast
other	Comparison.Contrast
cities,	Comparison.Contrast
but	Comparison.Contrast
you	_
also	Expansion.Conjunction
have	_
this	_
very	_
predominant	_
group	_
of	_
geeks	_
and	_
techies	_
that	_
are	_
sort	_
of	_
taking	_
over	_
the	_
top	_
half	_
of	_
the	_
network,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
there's	_
even	_
a	_
group	_
that's	_
so	Contingency.Cause.Result
distinct	Contingency.Cause.Result
and	Contingency.Cause.Result
clear	Contingency.Cause.Result
that	Contingency.Cause.Result
we	_
can	_
identify	_
it	_
as	_
Twitter	_
employees,	_
next	_
to	_
the	_
geeks,	_
in	_
between	_
the	_
gamers	_
and	_
the	_
geeks,	_
at	_
the	_
opposite	_
end	_
of	_
the	_
hip-hop	_
spectrum.	_
So	Contingency.Cause+Belief.Result+Belief
you	_
can	_
see,	_
though,	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
that	_
the	_
tensions	_
that	_
we've	_
heard	_
about	_
in	_
San	_
Francisco	_
in	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
terms	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
of	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
people	_
being	_
concerned	_
about	_
gentrification	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
all	_
the	_
new	_
tech	_
companies	_
that	_
are	_
bringing	_
new	_
wealth	_
and	_
settlement	_
into	_
the	_
city	_
are	_
real,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
you	_
can	_
actually	_
see	_
that	_
documented	_
here.	_
You	_
can	_
see	_
the	_
LGBT	_
community	_
is	_
not	_
really	_
getting	_
along	_
with	_
the	_
geek	_
community	_
that	_
well,	_
the	_
arts	_
community,	_
the	_
music	_
community.	_
And	Expansion.Conjunction
so	Contingency.Cause.Result
it	_
leads	_
to	_
things	_
like	_
this.	_
["Evict	_
Twitter"]	_
Somebody	_
sent	_
me	_
this	_
photo	_
a	_
few	_
weeks	_
ago,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
it	_
shows	_
what	_
is	_
happening	_
on	_
the	_
ground	_
in	_
San	_
Francisco,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
I	_
think	_
you	_
can	_
actually	_
try	_
to	_
understand	_
that	_
through	Expansion.Manner.Arg2-as-manner
looking	_
at	_
a	_
map	_
like	_
this.	_
Let's	_
take	_
a	_
look	_
at	_
Rio	_
de	_
Janeiro.	_
I	_
spent	_
the	_
last	_
few	_
weeks	_
gathering	_
data	_
about	_
Rio,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
one	_
of	_
the	_
things	_
that	_
stood	_
out	_
to	_
me	_
about	_
this	_
city	_
is	_
that	_
everything's	_
really	_
kind	_
of	_
mixed	_
up.	_
It's	_
a	_
very	_
heterogenous	_
city	_
in	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail
a	_
way	_
that	_
Baltimore	_
or	_
San	_
Francisco	_
is	_
not.	_
You	_
still	_
have	_
the	_
lobe	_
of	_
people	_
involved	_
with	_
government,	_
newspapers,	_
politics,	_
columnists.	_
TEDxRio	_
is	_
down	_
in	_
the	_
lower	_
right,	_
right	_
next	_
to	_
bloggers	_
and	_
writers.	_
But	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
then	_
you	_
also	Expansion.Conjunction
have	_
this	_
tremendous	_
diversity	_
of	_
people	_
that	_
are	_
interested	_
in	_
different	_
kinds	_
of	_
music.	_
Even	Expansion.Instantiation
Justin	_
Bieber	_
fans	_
are	_
represented	_
here.	_
Other	_
boy	_
bands,	_
country	_
singers,	_
gospel	_
music,	_
funk	_
and	_
rap	_
and	_
stand-up	_
comedy,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
there's	_
even	_
a	_
whole	_
section	_
around	_
drugs	_
and	_
jokes.	_
How	_
cool	_
is	_
that?	_
And	Expansion.Conjunction
then	_
the	_
Flamengo	_
football	_
team	_
is	_
also	Expansion.Conjunction
represented	_
here.	_
So	Contingency.Cause+Belief.Result+Belief
you	_
have	_
that	_
same	_
kind	_
of	_
spread	_
of	_
sports	_
and	_
civics	_
and	_
the	_
arts	_
and	_
music,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
it's	_
represented	_
in	_
a	_
very	_
different	_
way,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
I	_
think	_
that	_
maybe	_
fits	_
with	_
our	_
understanding	_
of	_
Rio	_
as	_
being	_
a	_
very	_
multicultural,	_
musically	_
diverse	_
city.	_
So	_
we	_
have	_
all	_
this	_
data.	_
It's	_
an	_
incredibly	_
rich	_
set	_
of	_
data	_
that	_
we	_
have	_
about	_
cities	_
now,	_
maybe	_
even	_
richer	_
than	_
any	_
data	_
set	_
that	_
we've	_
ever	_
had	_
before.	_
So	Contingency.Cause+SpeechAct.Result+SpeechAct
what	Hypophora
can	_
we	_
do	_
with	_
it?	_
Well,	_
I	_
think	_
the	_
first	_
thing	_
that	_
we	_
can	_
try	_
to	_
understand	_
is	_
that	_
segregation	_
is	_
a	_
social	_
construct.	_
It's	_
something	_
that	_
we	_
choose	_
to	_
do,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
we	_
could	_
choose	_
not	_
to	_
do	_
it,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
you	_
kind	_
of	_
think	_
about	_
it,	_
what	_
we're	_
doing	_
with	_
this	_
data	_
is	_
aiming	_
a	_
space	_
telescope	_
at	_
a	_
city	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
looking	_
at	_
it	_
as	Expansion.Manner.Arg2-as-manner
if	Expansion.Manner.Arg2-as-manner
was	_
a	_
giant	_
high	_
school	_
cafeteria,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
seeing	_
how	_
everybody	_
arranged	_
themselves	_
in	_
a	_
seating	_
chart.	_
Well	_
maybe	_
it's	_
time	_
to	_
shake	_
up	_
the	_
seating	_
chart	_
a	_
little	_
bit.	_
The	_
other	_
thing	_
that	_
we	_
start	_
to	_
realize	_
is	_
that	_
race	_
is	_
a	_
really	_
poor	_
proxy	_
for	_
diversity.	_
We've	_
got	_
people	_
represented	_
from	_
all	_
different	_
types	_
of	_
races	_
across	_
the	_
entire	_
map	_
here	_
--	_
only	_
looking	_
at	_
race	_
doesn't	_
really	_
contribute	_
to	_
our	_
development	_
of	_
diversity.	_
So	Contingency.Cause.Result
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we're	_
trying	_
to	_
use	_
diversity	_
as	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal|Expansion.Manner.Arg1-as-manner
a	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal|Expansion.Manner.Arg1-as-manner
way	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal|Expansion.Manner.Arg1-as-manner
to	_
tackle	_
some	_
of	_
our	_
more	_
intractable	_
problems,	_
we	_
need	_
to	_
start	_
to	_
think	_
about	_
diversity	_
in	_
a	_
new	_
way.	_
And	_
lastly,	Expansion.Conjunction
we	_
have	_
the	_
ability	_
to	_
create	_
interventions	_
to	_
start	_
to	_
reshape	_
our	_
cities	_
in	_
a	_
new	_
way,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
I	_
believe	_
that	_
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	_
have	_
that	_
capability,	_
we	_
may	_
even	_
bear	_
some	_
responsibility	_
to	_
do	_
so.	_
So	_
what	Hypophora
is	_
a	_
city?	_
I	_
think	_
some	_
might	_
say	_
that	_
it	_
is	_
a	_
geographical	_
area	_
or	_
a	_
collection	_
of	_
streets	_
and	_
buildings,	_
but	Comparison.Contrast
I	_
believe	_
that	_
a	_
city	_
is	_
the	_
sum	_
of	_
the	_
relationships	_
of	_
the	_
people	_
that	_
live	_
there,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
I	_
believe	_
that	_
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	_
can	_
start	_
to	_
document	_
those	_
relationships	_
in	_
a	_
real	_
way	_
then	_
maybe	_
we	_
have	_
a	_
real	_
shot	_
at	_
creating	_
those	_
kinds	_
of	_
cities	_
that	_
we'd	_
like	_
to	_
have.	_
Thank	_
you.	_
