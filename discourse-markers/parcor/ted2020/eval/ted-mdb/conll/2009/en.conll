A	_
glimpse	_
of	_
life	_
on	_
the	_
road	_
As	_
a	_
little	_
girl,	_
I	_
always	_
imagined	_
I	_
would	_
one	_
day	_
run	_
away.	_
From	_
the	_
age	_
of	_
six	_
on,	_
I	_
kept	_
a	_
packed	_
bag	_
with	_
some	_
clothes	_
and	_
cans	_
of	_
food	_
tucked	_
away	_
in	_
the	_
back	_
of	_
a	_
closet.	_
There	_
was	_
a	_
deep	_
restlessness	_
in	_
me,	_
a	_
primal	_
fear	_
that	_
I	_
would	_
fall	_
prey	_
to	_
a	_
life	_
of	_
routine	_
and	_
boredom.	_
And	Expansion.Conjunction
so,	Contingency.Cause.Result
many	_
of	_
my	_
early	_
memories	_
involved	_
intricate	_
daydreams	_
where	_
I	_
would	_
walk	_
across	_
borders,	_
forage	_
for	_
berries,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
meet	_
all	_
kinds	_
of	_
strange	_
people	_
living	_
unconventional	_
lives	_
on	_
the	_
road.	_
Years	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence
have	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence
passed,	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
many	_
of	_
the	_
adventures	_
I	_
fantasized	_
about	_
as	_
a	_
child	_
--	_
traveling	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
weaving	_
my	_
way	_
between	_
worlds	_
other	_
than	_
my	_
own	_
—	_
have	_
become	_
realities	_
through	Expansion.Manner.Arg2-as-manner
my	_
work	_
as	_
a	_
documentary	_
photographer.	_
But	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
no	_
other	_
experience	_
has	_
felt	_
as	_
true	_
to	_
my	_
childhood	_
dreams	_
as	Comparison.Similarity
living	_
amongst	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
documenting	_
the	_
lives	_
of	_
fellow	_
wanderers	_
across	_
the	_
United	_
States.	_
This	_
is	_
the	_
nomadic	_
dream,	_
a	_
different	_
kind	_
of	_
American	_
dream	_
lived	_
by	_
young	_
hobos,	_
travelers,	_
hitchhikers,	_
vagrants	_
and	_
tramps.	_
In	_
most	_
of	_
our	_
minds,	_
the	_
vagabond	_
is	_
a	_
creature	_
from	_
the	_
past.	_
The	_
word	_
"hobo"	_
conjures	_
up	_
an	_
old	_
black	_
and	_
white	_
image	_
of	_
a	_
weathered	_
old	_
man	_
covered	_
in	_
coal,	_
legs	_
dangling	_
out	_
of	_
a	_
boxcar,	_
but	Comparison.Contrast
these	_
photographs	_
are	_
in	_
color,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
they	_
portray	_
a	_
community	_
swirling	_
across	_
the	_
country,	_
fiercely	_
alive	_
and	_
creatively	_
free,	_
seeing	_
sides	_
of	_
America	_
that	_
no	_
one	_
else	_
gets	_
to	_
see.	_
Like	_
their	_
predecessors,	_
today's	_
nomads	_
travel	_
the	_
steel	_
and	_
asphalt	_
arteries	_
of	_
the	_
United	_
States.	_
By	_
day,	_
they	_
hop	_
freight	_
trains,	_
stick	_
out	_
their	_
thumbs,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
ride	_
the	_
highways	_
with	_
anyone	_
from	_
truckers	_
to	_
soccer	_
moms.	_
By	_
night,	_
they	_
sleep	_
beneath	_
the	_
stars,	_
huddled	_
together	_
with	_
their	_
packs	_
of	_
dogs,	_
cats	_
and	_
pet	_
rats	_
between	_
their	_
bodies.	_
Some	_
travelers	_
take	_
to	_
the	_
road	_
by	_
choice,	_
renouncing	_
materialism,	_
traditional	_
jobs	_
and	_
university	_
degrees	_
in	_
exchange	_
for	_
a	_
glimmer	_
of	_
adventure.	_
Others	_
come	_
from	_
the	_
underbelly	_
of	_
society,	_
never	_
given	_
a	_
chance	_
to	_
mobilize	_
upwards:	_
foster	_
care	_
dropouts,	_
teenage	_
runaways	_
escaping	_
abuse	_
and	_
unforgiving	_
homes.	_
Where	Comparison.Contrast
others	_
see	_
stories	_
of	_
privation	_
and	_
economic	_
failure,	_
travelers	_
view	_
their	_
own	_
existence	_
through	_
the	_
prism	_
of	_
liberation	_
and	_
freedom.	_
They'd	_
rather	Expansion.Substitution.Arg1-as-subst
live	Expansion.Substitution.Arg1-as-subst
off	Expansion.Substitution.Arg1-as-subst
of	Expansion.Substitution.Arg1-as-subst
the	Expansion.Substitution.Arg1-as-subst

what	Expansion.Substitution.Arg1-as-subst

away	_
at	_
an	_
unrealistic	_
chance	_
at	_
the	_
traditional	_
American	_
dream.	_
They	_
take	_
advantage	_
of	_
the	_
fact	_
that	_
in	_
the	_
United	_
States,	_
up	_
to	_
40	_
percent	_
of	_
all	_
food	_
ends	_
up	_
in	_
the	_
garbage	_
by	Expansion.Manner.Arg2-as-manner
scavenging	_
for	_
perfectly	_
good	_
produce	_
in	_
dumpsters	_
and	_
trash	_
cans.	_
They	_
sacrifice	_
material	_
comforts	_
in	Temporal.Synchronous
exchange	_
for	_
the	_
space	_
and	_
the	_
time	_
to	_
explore	_
a	_
creative	_
interior,	_
to	_
dream,	_
to	_
read,	_
to	_
work	_
on	_
music,	_
art	_
and	_
writing.	_
But	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
there	_
are	_
many	_
aspects	_
to	_
this	_
life	_
that	_
are	_
far	_
from	_
idyllic.	_
No	_
one	_
loses	_
their	_
inner	_
demons	_
by	Expansion.Manner.Arg2-as-manner
taking	_
to	_
the	_
road.	_
Addiction	_
is	_
real,	_
the	_
elements	_
are	_
real,	_
freight	_

maim	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
kill,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
anyone	_
who	_
has	_
lived	_
on	_
the	_
streets	_
can	_
attest	_
to	_
the	_
exhaustive	_
list	_
of	_
laws	_
that	_
criminalize	_
homeless	_
existence.	_
Who	Hypophora
here	Hypophora
knows	Hypophora
that	_
in	_
many	_
cities	_
across	_
the	_
United	_
States	_
it	_
is	_
now	_
illegal	_
to	_
sit	_
on	_
the	_
sidewalk,	_
to	_
wrap	_
oneself	_
in	_
a	_
blanket,	_
to	_
sleep	_
in	_
your	_
own	_
car,	_
to	_
offer	_
food	_
to	_
a	_
stranger?	_
I	_
know	_
about	_
these	_
laws	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
I've	_
watched	_
as	_
friends	_
and	_
other	_
travelers	_
were	_
hauled	_
off	_
to	_
jail	_
or	Expansion.Disjunction
received	_
citations	_
for	Contingency.Cause.Reason
committing	_
these	_
so-called	_
crimes.	_
Many	_
of	_
you	_
might	_
be	_
wondering	_
why	Hypophora
anyone	_
would	_
choose	_
a	_
life	_
like	_
this,	_
under	_
the	_
thumb	_
of	_
discriminatory	_
laws,	_
eating	_
out	_
of	_
trash	_
cans,	_
sleeping	_
under	_
bridges,	_
picking	_
up	_
seasonal	_
jobs	_
here	_
and	_
there.	_
The	_
answer	_
to	_
such	_
a	_
question	_
is	_
as	_
varied	_
as	_
the	_
people	_
that	_
take	_
to	_
the	_
road,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
travelers	_
often	_
respond	_
with	_
a	_
single	_
word:	_
freedom.	_
Until	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	_
live	_
in	_
a	_
society	_
where	_
every	_
human	_
is	_
assured	_
dignity	_
in	_
their	_
labor	_
so	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal
that	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal
they	_
can	_
work	_
to	_
live	_
well,	_
not	_
only	_
work	_
to	_
survive,	_
there	_
will	_
always	_
be	_
an	_
element	_
of	_
those	_
who	_
seek	_
the	_
open	_
road	_
as	_
a	_
means	_
of	_
escape,	_
of	_
liberation	_
and,	_
of	_
course,	_
of	_
rebellion.	_
Thank	_
you.	_
