The	_
flower-shaped	_
starshade	_
that	_
might	_
help	_
us	_
detect	_
Earth-like	_
planets	_
The	_
universe	_
is	_
teeming	_
with	_
planets.	_
I	_
want	_
us,	_
in	_
the	_
next	_
decade,	_
to	_
build	_
a	_
space	_
telescope	_
that'll	_
be	_
able	_
to	_
image	_
an	_
Earth	_
about	_
another	_
star	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
figure	_
out	_
whether	_
it	_
can	_
harbor	_
life.	_
My	_
colleagues	_
at	_
the	_
NASA	_
Jet	_
Propulsion	_
Laboratory	_
at	_
Princeton	_
and	_
I	_
are	_
working	_
on	_
technology	_
that	_
will	_
be	_
able	_
to	_
do	_
just	_
that	_
in	_
the	_
coming	_
years.	_
Astronomers	_
now	_
believe	_
that	_
every	_
star	_
in	_
the	_
galaxy	_
has	_
a	_
planet,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
they	_
speculate	_
that	_
up	_
to	_
one	_
fifth	_
of	_
them	_
have	_
an	_
Earth-like	_
planet	_
that	_
might	_
be	_
able	_
to	_
harbor	_
life,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
we	_
haven't	_
seen	_
any	_
of	_
them.	_
We've	_
only	_
detected	_
them	_
indirectly.	_
This	_
is	_
NASA's	_
famous	_
picture	_
of	_
the	_
pale	_
blue	_
dot.	_
It	_
was	_
taken	_
by	_
the	_
Voyager	_
spacecraft	_
in	_
1990,	_
when	Temporal.Synchronous
they	_
turned	_
it	_
around	_
as	Temporal.Synchronous
it	_
was	_
exiting	_
the	_
solar	_
system	_
to	_
take	_
a	_
picture	_
of	_
the	_
Earth	_
from	_
six	_
billion	_
kilometers	_
away.	_
I	_
want	_
to	_
take	_
that	_
of	_
an	_
Earth-like	_
planet	_
about	_
another	_
star.	_
Why	_
haven't	_
we	_
done	_
that?	_
Why	Hypophora
is	_
that	_
hard?	_
Well	_
to	_
see,	_
let's	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
imagine	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	_
take	_
the	_
Hubble	_
Space	_
Telescope	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
we	_
turn	_
it	_
around	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
we	_
move	_
it	_
out	_
to	_
the	_
orbit	_
of	_
Mars.	_
We'll	_
see	_
something	_
like	_
that,	_
a	_
slightly	_
blurry	_
picture	_
of	_
the	_
Earth,	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
we're	_
a	_
fairly	_
small	_
telescope	_
out	_
at	_
the	_
orbit	_
of	_
Mars.	_
Now	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence
let's	_
move	_
ten	_
times	_
further	_
away.	_
Here	_
we	_
are	_
at	_
the	_
orbit	_
of	_
Uranus.	_
It's	_
gotten	_
smaller,	_
it's	_
got	_
less	_
detail,	_
less	_
resolve.	_
We	_
can	_
still	_
see	_
the	_
little	_
moon,	_
but	Expansion.Conjunction
let's	_
go	_
ten	_
times	_
further	_
away	_
again.	_
Here	_
we	_
are	_
at	_
the	_
edge	_
of	_
the	_
solar	_
system,	_
out	_
at	_
the	_
Kuiper	_
Belt.	_
Now	Temporal.Synchronous
it's	_
not	_
resolved	_
at	_
all.	_
It's	_
that	_
pale	_
blue	_
dot	_
of	_
Carl	_
Sagan's.	_
But	Expansion.Conjunction
let's	_
move	_
yet	_
again	_
ten	_
times	_
further	_
away.	_
Here	_
we	_
are	_
out	_
at	_
the	_
Oort	_
Cloud,	_
outside	_
the	_
solar	_
system,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
we're	_
starting	_
to	_
see	_
the	_
sun	_
move	_
into	_
the	_
field	_
of	_
view	_
and	_
get	_
into	_
where	_
the	_
planet	_
is.	_
One	_
more	_
time,	_
ten	_
times	_
further	_
away.	_
Now	_
we're	_
at	_
Alpha	_
Centauri,	_
our	_
nearest	_
neighbor	_
star,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
the	_
planet	_
is	_
gone.	_
All	_
we're	_
seeing	_
is	_
the	_
big	_
beaming	_
image	_
of	_
the	_
star	_
that's	_
ten	_
billion	_
times	_
brighter	_
than	_
the	_
planet,	_
which	_
should	_
be	_
in	_
that	_
little	_
red	_
circle.	_
That's	_
what	_
we	_
want	_
to	_
see.	_
That's	Contingency.Cause.Reason
why	Contingency.Cause.Reason
it's	_
hard.	_
The	_
light	_
from	_
the	_
star	_
is	_
diffracting.	_
It's	_
scattering	_
inside	_
the	_
telescope,	_
creating	_
that	_
very	_
bright	_
image	_
that	_
washes	_
out	_
the	_
planet.	_
So	Contingency.Cause.Result
to	_
see	_
the	_
planet,	_
we	_
have	_
to	_
do	_
something	_
about	_
all	_
of	_
that	_
light.	_
We	_
have	_
to	_
get	_
rid	_
of	_
it.	_
I	_
have	_
a	_
lot	_
of	_
colleagues	_
working	_
on	_
really	_
amazing	_
technologies	_
to	_
do	_
that,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
I	_
want	_
to	_
tell	_
you	_
about	_
one	_
today	_
that	_
I	_
think	_
is	_
the	_
coolest,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
probably	_
the	_
most	_
likely	_
to	_
get	_
us	_
an	_
Earth	_
in	_
the	_
next	_
decade.	_
It	_
was	_
first	_
suggested	_
by	_
Lyman	_
Spitzer,	_
the	_
father	_
of	_
the	_
space	_
telescope,	_
in	_
1962,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
he	_
took	_
his	_
inspiration	_
from	_
an	_
eclipse.	_
You've	_
all	_
seen	_
that.	_
That's	_
a	_
solar	_
eclipse.	_
The	_
moon	_
has	_
moved	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
the	_
sun.	_
It	_
blocks	_
out	_
most	_
of	_
the	_
light	_
so	Contingency.Cause.Result
we	_
can	_
see	_
that	_
dim	_
corona	_
around	_
it.	_
It	Expansion.Equivalence
would	Expansion.Equivalence
be	Expansion.Equivalence
the	Expansion.Equivalence
same	Expansion.Equivalence
thing	Expansion.Equivalence
if	_
I	_
put	_
my	_
thumb	_
up	_
and	_
blocked	_
that	_
spotlight	_
that's	_
getting	_
right	_
in	_
my	_
eye,	_
I	_
can	_
see	_
you	_
in	_
the	_
back	_
row.	_
Well,	_
what's	Hypophora
going	_
on?	_
Well	_
the	_
moon	_
is	_
casting	_
a	_
shadow	_
down	_
on	_
the	_
Earth.	_
We	_
put	_
a	_
telescope	_
or	_
a	_
camera	_
in	_
that	_
shadow,	_
we	_
look	_
back	_
at	_
the	_
sun,	_
and	Contingency.Condition.Arg1-as-cond
most	_
of	_
the	_
light's	_
been	_
removed	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
we	_
can	_
see	_
that	_
dim,	_
fine	_
structure	_
in	_
the	_
corona.	_
Spitzer's	_
suggestion	_
was	_
we	_
do	_
this	_
in	_
space.	_
We	_
build	_
a	_
big	_
screen,	_
we	_
fly	_
it	_
in	_
space,	_
we	_
put	_
it	_
up	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
the	_
star,	_
we	_
block	_
out	_
most	_
of	_
the	_
light,	_
we	_
fly	_
a	_
space	_
telescope	_
in	_
that	_
shadow	_
that's	_
created,	_
and	_
boom,	Contingency.Cause.Result
we	_
get	_
to	_
see	_
planets.	_
Well	_
that	_
would	_
look	_
something	_
like	_
this.	_
So	_
there's	_
that	_
big	_
screen,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
there's	_
no	_
planets,	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
unfortunately	_
it	_
doesn't	_
actually	_
work	_
very	_
well,	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
the	_
light	_
waves	_
of	_
the	_
light	_
and	_
waves	_
diffracts	_
around	_
that	_
screen	_
the	Comparison.Similarity
same	Comparison.Similarity
way	Comparison.Similarity
it	_
did	_
in	_
the	_
telescope.	_
It's	Comparison.Similarity
like	Comparison.Similarity
water	_
bending	_
around	_
a	_
rock	_
in	_
a	_
stream,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
all	_
that	_
light	_
just	_
destroys	_
the	_
shadow.	_
It's	_
a	_
terrible	_
shadow.	_
And	Expansion.Conjunction
we	_
can't	_
see	_
planets.	_
But	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
Spitzer	_
actually	_
knew	_
the	_
answer.	_
If	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	_
can	_
feather	_
the	_
edges,	_
soften	_
those	_
edges	_
so	Contingency.Cause.Result
we	_
can	_
control	_
diffraction,	_
well	_
then	_
we	_
can	_
see	_
a	_
planet,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
in	_
the	_
last	_
10	_
years	_
or	_
so	_
we've	_
come	_
up	_
with	_
optimal	_
solutions	_
for	_
doing	_
that.	_
It	_
looks	_
something	_
like	_
that.	_
We	_
call	_
that	_
our	_
flower	_
petal	_
starshade.	_
If	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
make	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
the	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
edges	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
of	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
those	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
petals	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
exactly	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
right,	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	_
control	_
their	_
shape,	_
we	_
can	_
control	_
diffraction,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
now	_
we	_
have	_
a	_
great	_
shadow.	_
It's	_
about	_
10	_
billion	_
times	_
dimmer	_
than	_
it	_
was	_
before,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
we	_
can	_
see	_
the	_
planets	_
beam	_
out	_
just	_
like	_
that.	_
That,	_
of	_
course,	_
has	_
to	_
be	_
bigger	_
than	_
my	_
thumb.	_
That	_
starshade	_
is	_
about	_
the	_
size	_
of	_
half	_
a	_
football	_
field	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
it	_
has	_
to	_
fly	_
50,000	_
kilometers	_
away	_
from	_
the	_
telescope	_
that	_
has	_
to	_
be	_
held	_
right	_
in	_
its	_
shadow,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
then	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence
we	_
can	_
see	_
those	_
planets.	_
This	_
sounds	_
formidable,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
brilliant	_
engineers,	_
colleagues	_
of	_
mine	_
at	_
JPL,	_
came	_
up	_
with	_
a	_
fabulous	_
design	_
for	_
how	_
to	_
do	_
that	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
it	_
looks	_
like	_
this.	_
It	_
starts	_
wrapped	_
around	_
a	_
hub.	_
It	_
separates	_
from	_
the	_
telescope.	_
The	_
petals	_
unfurl,	_
they	_
open	_
up,	_
the	_
telescope	_
turns	_
around.	_
Then	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence
you'll	_
see	_
it	_
flip	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
fly	_
out	_
that	_
50,000	_
kilometers	_
away	_
from	_
the	_
telescope.	_
It's	_
going	_
to	_
move	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
the	_
star	_
just	_
like	_
that,	_
creates	_
a	_
wonderful	_
shadow.	_
Boom,	Contingency.Cause.Result
we	_
get	_
planets	_
orbiting	_
about	_
it.	_
(Applause)	_
Thank	_
you.	_
That's	_
not	_
science	_
fiction.	_
We've	_
been	_
working	_
on	_
this	_
for	_
the	_
last	_
five	_
or	_
six	_
years.	_
Last	_
summer,	_
we	_
did	_
a	_
really	_
cool	_
test	_
out	_
in	_
California	_
at	_
Northrop	_
Grumman.	_
So	_
those	_
are	_
four	_
petals.	_
This	_
is	_
a	_
sub-scale	_
star	_
shade.	_
It's	_
about	_
half	_
the	_
size	_
of	_
the	_
one	_
you	_
just	_
saw.	_
You'll	_
see	_
the	_
petals	_
unfurl.	_
Those	_
four	_
petals	_
were	_
built	_
by	_
four	_
undergraduates	_
doing	_
a	_
summer	_
internship	_
at	_
JPL.	_
Now	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence
you're	_
seeing	_
it	_
deploy.	_
Those	_
petals	_
have	_
to	_
rotate	_
into	_
place.	_
The	_
base	_
of	_
those	_
petals	_
has	_
to	_
go	_
to	_
the	_
same	_
place	_
every	_
time	_
to	_
within	_
a	_
tenth	_
of	_
a	_
millimeter.	_
We	_
ran	_
this	_
test	_
16	_
times,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
16	_
times	_
it	_
went	_
into	_
the	_
exact	_
same	_
place	_
to	_
a	_
tenth	_
of	_
a	_
millimeter.	_
This	_
has	_
to	_
be	_
done	_
very	_
precisely,	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
can	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
do	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
this,	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
can	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
build	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
this	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
technology,	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
if	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	_
can	_
get	_
it	_
into	_
space,	_
you	_
might	_
see	_
something	_
like	_
this.	_
That's	_
a	_
picture	_
of	_
one	_
our	_
nearest	_
neighbor	_
stars	_
taken	_
with	_
the	_
Hubble	_
Space	_
Telescope.	_
If	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond
we	_
can	_
take	_
a	_
similar	_
space	_
telescope,	_
slightly	_
larger,	_
put	_
it	_
out	_
there,	_
fly	_
an	_
occulter	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
it,	_
what	_
we	_
might	_
see	_
is	_
something	_
like	_
that	_
--	_
that's	_
a	_
family	_
portrait	_
of	_
our	_
solar	_
system	_
--	_
but	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier
not	_
ours.	_
We're	_
hoping	_
it'll	_
be	_
someone	_
else's	_
solar	_
system	_
as	_
seen	_
through	_
an	_
occulter,	_
through	_
a	_
starshade	_
like	_
that.	_
You	_
can	_
see	_
Jupiter,	_
you	_
can	_
see	_
Saturn,	_
Uranus,	_
Neptune,	_
and	Expansion.Conjunction
right	_
there	_
in	_
the	_
center,	_
next	_
to	_
the	_
residual	_
light	_
is	_
that	_
pale	_
blue	_
dot.	_
That's	_
Earth.	_
We	_
want	_
to	_
see	_
that,	_
see	_
if	_
there's	_
water,	_
oxygen,	_
ozone,	_
the	_
things	_
that	_
might	_
tell	_
us	_
that	_
it	_
could	_
harbor	_
life.	_
I	_
think	_
this	_
is	_
the	_
coolest	_
possible	_
science.	_
That's	_
why	_
I	_
got	_
into	_
doing	_
this,	_
because	Contingency.Cause.Reason
I	_
think	_
that	_
will	_
change	_
the	_
world.	_
That	_
will	_
change	_
everything	_
when	_
we	_
see	_
that.	_
Thank	_
you.	_
