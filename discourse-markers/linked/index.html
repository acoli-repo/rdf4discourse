<h1 id="linked-ontolex-discourse-marker-inventories">linked OntoLex discourse marker inventories</h1>
<p>for every converted OntoLex discourse marker inventory - load the OLiA PDTB ontology (http://purl.org/olia/discourse/discourse.PDTB.owl) into the local graph - match dimlex:sense against PDTB labels - create ontolex:reference between OntoLex sense and PDTB concept - return OntoLex propertys or classes, prune everything else - manually added machine-readable license information - attribution information added - linked data release under http://purl.org/acoli/dimlex/*</p>
<p>Note that this is currently hosted by GitHub, so, no support for content negotation or redirection. Hence, the file suffix had to be included in the URIs.</p>
