We do not provide the original DimLex file because of their problematic copyright situation: Note the lack of any licensing and attribution information in these files. Under American copyright law, our lemon transformation would be fair use. Under German copyright law, we expect that the threshold of originality required for copyright is not met by a small-scale dictionary of high-frequency words for a well-resourced language. The main contribution is mapping to PDTB3 senses, i.e., standardization.
