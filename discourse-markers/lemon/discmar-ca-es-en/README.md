Discourse marker inventory for English, Spanish and Catalan, Â© 2006 Laura Alonso i Alemany
======

Dimlex-like lemon edition of discourse marker lexicons for English, Spanish and Catalan compiled by Laura Alonso i Alemany, see [src](../../src/discmar) for the original sources.

Distinguishes only four discourse relations (plus coordinating/subordinating), roughly mapping to PDTB top-level classes (but cf. comparison-with-english-dimlex.tsv)

| DiscMark relation | PDTB relation |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| cause				| CONTINGENCY	|
| context*			| TEMPORAL*		|
| equality			| EXPANSION		|
| revision			| COMPARISON	|

* context is broader than PDTB TEMPORAL, this also includes circumstantial context (can be PDTB CONTIGENCY) and spatial context (not covered by PDTB)
