With respect to the effects on coherence and relevance, it is comparable to consecutive discourse markers like that's why or so then, which can also signal relations that are not motivated by a causal relation in the real world, but have the same rhetorical strength as those that are motivated by a real causal relation. It is comparable to in effect." ;

By default, we ascribe it to context, and only if there is enough evidence is it ascribed to equality." ;

        rdfs:comment  "actually / in fact their primary meaning is marking evidentiality [ex], but they tend to be structurally equivalent to however, as we have shown using multiple alignment techniques (Alonso et al. 2004). In English their evidentiality meaning is more predominant than the revision meaning, and so their contribution as discourse markers of revision is only reliable when it co-occurs with other discourse markers also signalling revision [ex] or in certain punctuation contexts [ex], although they can also signal revision without any of these further evidence [ex]. In Spanish and Catalan their primary meaning is revision ( [ex] and [ex]), respectively) comparable to it is true that. The kind of revision that these discourse markers tend to convey in Spanish and Catalan is correction (a prototypical example of correction would be: ``This is not black, but white.''). We can speculate that the reason why the revision meaning of these discourse markers is more primary in Spanish or Catalan than in English is because in these languages the correction meaning tends to be expressed by discourse markers, as can be seen in the fact that it is lexicalized (sinó, sino), while in English it is covered by the all-purpose revision discourse marker but, and correction is only distinguished from other kinds of revision by other linguistic features." ;

In this respect, it is different from anyway, which always conveys revision." ;

If they co-occur [ex], their scope can be determined if we consider that the scope of on the one hand reaches until the point of occurrence of on the other hand, and that the latter has a scope of an equivalent size. However, if on the other hand occurs alone, its scope is very hard to determine automatically, and probably also by human judges." ;

On the one hand, there is fundamentalist counter-ideology, the Islamic theocratic state. This, it is to be assumed, his liberal readers may take seriously as a threat, but hardly as an option. And on the other hand, there are &quot;less organised religious impulses&quot;, religion as individual preference. This he knows can readily be accommodated another sort of consumer commodity, &quot;within the sphere of personal life permitted in liberal societies&quot;." ;

If they co-occur [ex], their scope can be determined if we consider that the scope of on the one hand reaches until the point of occurrence of on the other hand, and that the latter has a scope of an equivalent size. However, if on the other hand occurs alone, its scope is very hard to determine automatically, and probably also by human judges." ;

On the one hand, there is fundamentalist counter-ideology, the Islamic theocratic state. This, it is to be assumed, his liberal readers may take seriously as a threat, but hardly as an option. And on the other hand, there are &quot;less organised religious impulses&quot;, religion as individual preference. This he knows can readily be accommodated another sort of consumer commodity, &quot;within the sphere of personal life permitted in liberal societies&quot;." ;

        rdfs:comment  "actually / in fact their primary meaning is marking evidentiality [ex], but they tend to be structurally equivalent to however, as we have shown using multiple alignment techniques (Alonso et al. 2004). In English their evidentiality meaning is more predominant than the revision meaning, and so their contribution as discourse markers of revision is only reliable when it co-occurs with other discourse markers also signalling revision [ex] or in certain punctuation contexts [ex], although they can also signal revision without any of these further evidence [ex]. In Spanish and Catalan their primary meaning is revision ( [ex] and [ex]), respectively) comparable to it is true that. The kind of revision that these discourse markers tend to convey in Spanish and Catalan is correction (a prototypical example of correction would be: ``This is not black, but white.''). We can speculate that the reason why the revision meaning of these discourse markers is more primary in Spanish or Catalan than in English is because in these languages the correction meaning tends to be expressed by discourse markers, as can be seen in the fact that it is lexicalized (sinó, sino), while in English it is covered by the all-purpose revision discourse marker but, and correction is only distinguished from other kinds of revision by other linguistic features." ;
