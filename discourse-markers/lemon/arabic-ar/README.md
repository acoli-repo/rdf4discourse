Arabic discourse marker lexicon
=======

Note that this contains lemmas only, not fully inflected forms.

DimLex and Lemon versions generated from XML provided by https://github.com/discourse-lab/Connective-Lex.info/blob/master/Original%20lexicons/Arabic%20Discours%20cues.xml.

We do not provide the original XML files because of their problematic copyright situation: Note the lack of any licensing, attribution and provenance information in these files. Under American copyright law, our lemon transformation would be fair use. Under German copyright law, we expect that the threshold of originality required for copyright is not met by a small-scale dictionary of high-frequency words for a well-resourced language.
